# Gaming Paradise

The Game Catalog is a simple web application that allows users to browse and search for games. It fetches game data from the RAWG API and displays it in a visually appealing manner, including game details such as name, rating, release date, and metacritic score. The application will also provide features like pagination, sorting, and filtering to enhance the user experience.

## Hosted Site

The web site is hosted on GitHub Pages on the url: https://dimifabbridf96.github.io/VideoGamesApi/

to access the full functionality of the web site is needed an API key that is kept secret using a different file that is accessible only in development, to improve the security of the website,and not in production because not uploaded using .gitignore.
I will provide the API key in the planning analysis sheet to be replaced in the url variable
